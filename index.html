        <!--After having learned enough from the CCAs, I plan to remake the entire website from the groundup. Right now, the website is more a personal school project rather than something useful.

                <ul>
                    <li>Danmaku - the romanji for 弾幕, which means "bullet hell" in Japanese.</li>
                    <li>Mukyu (むきゆ)- A fan-popular phrase sometimes said by Patchouli Knowledge, a character from Embodiment of the Scarlet Devil.</li>
                    <li>Gensokyo - the main location used in Touhou Project. It is said to be located in and around the Yatsugatake Mountains in Japan.</li>
                    <li>Fumo (ふも) - plushie recreations of Touhou characters manufactured and sold by GIFT. They are very popular within the fandom and can be bought online through GIFT's website.</li>
                    <li>1cc (One Credit Clear) - a term frequently used by players of the Touhou games. To accomplish a 1cc run, you must beat a game without having to use an extra credit.</li>
